                <p>Duncan, is the man. The customer service is outstanding. The prices are amazing and I will be back again and again. No hassle going to the hot stuffy tent and paying double. I ordered mine in bed watching TV and got it the next day. Beautiful, colourful and dazzling fireworks that Make lasting memories at an amazing price. The whole internet fireworks thing had me scared. Duds, shipping, quality, display but I am sold these fireworks are 100% the way to go. </p>

                <p> Look, the customer service offered by ProvoFireworks com is exceptional. The ordering process is easy, and there are videos by each item that allow you to know exactly what you are going to be getting. The owner goes the extra mile and then some to make sure the purchasing experience is awesome. Prices are great too. I have no doubt that most people that order from ProvoFireworks com will order again, I will for sure. </p>
